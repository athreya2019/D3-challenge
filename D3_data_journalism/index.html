          <h2>Relationship Between Smokers Vs age based on US State Dataset from 2014</h2>
          <p>Select various headings (Poverty, Age, Household Income,Obesity, Smokers, and Without Healthcare) to view state level details represented in circles
	    These circles can then be selected or hovered over to view the specific values for that state.  </p>

          <p>This data is older, 2014, but still relevant in demonstrating relatedness to the markers being measured. 
	     Selecting criteria of smokers vs age , we infer that Utah being the lowest % of smokers but with median age of 30.
             Also, West virgina has the highest percentage of smokers 
	     with a median age of 42.Similiarly selecting poverty and absence of healthcare , Texas, at the top of the graph, 
            having a poverty rate of 17.2 % with 24.9 % without healthcare and Massechusetts having a poverty rate of 11.6 % 
            but 4% rate without healthcare. </p>

          <p>Shifting the view again, selecting age instead of poverty, majority of those without 
            healthcare are in the 35 - 45 age range.  But selection of obesity and smokers doesn't shift
            the average age range by much at all!  The average age of all this data from 2014 seems to fall within that range. 
             </p>
